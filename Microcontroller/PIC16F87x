Microchip's PIC16F87x microcontrollers belong to a large family of microcontrollers with an 8-bit data bus, which have the following general characteristics that distinguish them from other families:

– Harvard Architecture
– RISC technology
– CMOS technology
– Only has 35 instructions to learn
– All instructions are executed in one clock cycle, except jumps, which require two cycles
– 0 to 20 MHz operating frequency (from DC to 200 ns instruction cycle)
– Up to 8K x 14 bits of FLASH memory for the program
– Up to 368 bytes of random access data memory (RAM)
– Up to 256 bytes of EEPROM data memory
– Up to 14 interrupt sources on 28-pin and 15 on 40-pin
– 8-level hardware stack
– Power on reset (BY)
– Power On Timer (PWRT)
– Oscillator Start Timer (OST)
– Watchdog Timer surveillance system (“wake-up” timer).
– A code protection can be programmed
– Low power consumption SLEEP mode
– Various options for the oscillator
– Serial programming and debugging (ICSP, In Circuit Serial Programming = Programming Serial In Circuit) through two pins
– CPU can read/write program FLASH memory
– Operating voltage range from 2.0 to 5.5 volts
– Can deliver high current on one output leg: 25 mA
– Temperature ranges: Commercial, Industrial and Extended
– Low power consumption:
    . Less than 0.6mA at 3V, 4MHz
    . 20 µA at 3 V, 32 KHz
    . Less than 1µA of current in latent state (stand by).
