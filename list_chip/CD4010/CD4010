CMOS/TTL INTERFACE

For hardware realization, it is used in this function
(digital inputs) the bottom of port B
( RB0,RB1,RB2,RB3), as input, but to avoid
the drawback that the PLC inputs must comply with the CMOS standard at 12 volts,
and the PIC port B inputs are CMOS compliant but low voltage (+5V),
the input signal was conditioned with a voltage level converter, such as the CD4010,
which as shown in figure 1.4, the main function
is to couple high voltage CMOS logic to low voltage
